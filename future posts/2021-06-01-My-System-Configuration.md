I use Ubuntu 18.04 with i3wm and use zsh as a terminal with prezto configuration. Lately I succeeded in programming 
my Atmega328p using eclipse on Linux instead of Microchip Studio (Atmel Studio). I am using also LabView on Linux
and can check my grades and University contents using some scripts that my friends and colleagues wrote.
